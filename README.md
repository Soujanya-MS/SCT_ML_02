This project groups customers based on their shopping behavior using clustering techniques. It’s part of my SkillCraft ML Internship. The notebook explores the dataset, performs preprocessing and applies KMeans to create customer segments.

Tools

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

What’s included

Data loading and cleaning
Feature selection
KMeans clustering
Visualizing customer groups
Interpreting segments
Next steps

Add age and spending features, try hierarchical clustering, test 3D clustering and apply scaling for better cluster separation.
