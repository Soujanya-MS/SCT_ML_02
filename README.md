## 🛒 Customer Segmentation | Task 02

This project focuses on grouping customers based on their shopping behavior using clustering techniques. It was completed as part of my **SkillCraft ML Internship** and covers the end-to-end process of customer segmentation.

The notebook applies **KMeans clustering** to identify distinct customer groups and visualize patterns that can support data-driven marketing decisions.
